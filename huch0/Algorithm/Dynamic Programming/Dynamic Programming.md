# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful technique used in algorithm design and computer science to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It's particularly useful for problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, which means that the problem can be broken down into smaller, manageable parts and the optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its parts.

## Key Concepts

1. **Optimal Substructure**: This means that an optimal solution to a problem contains within it optimal solutions to subproblems. For example, the shortest path from point A to point B includes the shortest path from point A to any intermediate point C¹.

2. **Overlapping Subproblems**: This occurs when recursive algorithms revisit the same problems repeatedly. DP solves each subproblem only once and then saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the work of recomputing the answer every time the subproblem is encountered¹.

3. **Memoization**: This is a technique used to store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again, thus saving computation time³.

4. **Tabulation**: This is the opposite of memoization. It involves solving problems bottom-up, by filling up a table based on previous results and using these results to solve larger subproblems³.

## Optimal Substructure

Optimal substructure is a property of problems that can be solved by dynamic programming. It means that the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems. This property is what allows us to break down a problem into smaller subproblems and solve them independently.

For example, consider the problem of finding the shortest path from point A to point B. If we know the shortest path from point A to an intermediate point C, and the shortest path from point C to point B, then the shortest path from point A to point B is simply the sum of these two paths. This is an example of optimal substructure, as the optimal solution to the problem (the shortest path from A to B) can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems (the shortest paths from A to C and from C to B).

- If a new path (A -> B) is constructed without passing through C, then this problem does not have optimal substructure and cannot be solved using dynamic programming.

## Overlapping Subproblems

Overlapping subproblems occur when a recursive algorithm revisits the same subproblems multiple times. This can lead to redundant computation and inefficiency. Dynamic programming solves this problem by solving each subproblem only once and then saving its answer in a table, so that it can be reused when the subproblem is encountered again.

For example, consider the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. If we use a naive recursive algorithm to compute the nth Fibonacci number, we will end up recomputing the same subproblems multiple times. Dynamic programming solves this problem by storing the results of the subproblems in a table, so that they can be reused when needed.

f(5) = f(4) + f(3)
        |     |
        |    f(3) =  f(2) + f(1)
        |            |     |
        |            |     f(1) = 1
        |            f(2) = 1
        f(4) =  f(3) + f(2)
                |     |
                |    f(2) = 1
                f(3) =  f(2) + f(1)
                        |     |
                        |     f(1) = 1
                        f(2) = 1

- In the above example, f(3) and f(2) are computed multiple times, leading to redundant computation. Dynamic programming solves this problem by storing the results of these subproblems in a table, so that they can be reused when needed.

## Memoization

Memoization is a technique used to store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This can help improve the performance of recursive algorithms by avoiding redundant computation.

```python
def fibonacci(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo)
    return memo[n]

print(fibonacci(5)) # Output: 5

```

- In the above example, the `memo` dictionary is used to store the results of the Fibonacci function for each input `n`. If the result for a particular input `n` is already in the `memo` dictionary, it is returned directly without recomputing it. This helps avoid redundant computation and improves the performance of the Fibonacci function.

## Tabulation

Tabulation is the opposite of memoization. It involves solving problems bottom-up, by filling up a table based on previous results and using these results to solve larger subproblems. This can be more efficient than memoization in some cases, as it avoids the overhead of recursive function calls.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    table = [0] * (n + 1)
    table[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        table[i] = table[i - 1] + table[i - 2]
    return table[n]

print(fibonacci(5)) # Output: 5

```

- In the above example, the `table` list is used to store the results of the Fibonacci function for each input `n`. The function iterates from `2` to `n`, filling up the `table` list with the results of the Fibonacci function for each input. This avoids the overhead of recursive function calls and can be more efficient than memoization in some cases.

## Types of Dynamic Programming

1. **Top-Down DP (Memoization)**: This approach involves solving the problem recursively and storing the results of subproblems in a table (memo) to avoid redundant computation.

2. **Bottom-Up DP (Tabulation)**: This approach involves solving the problem iteratively, starting from the smallest subproblems and building up to the larger subproblems.

3. **Space-Optimized DP**: This approach involves optimizing the space complexity of a DP solution by only storing the results of the last two subproblems, rather than the entire table.

4. **State Compression DP**: This approach involves compressing the state space of a DP problem to reduce the space complexity of the solution.

5. **Subset Sum DP**: This approach involves solving problems where the goal is to find a subset of elements that sum up to a target value.

6. **Knapsack DP**: This approach involves solving problems where the goal is to maximize the value of items in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.

7. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) DP**: This approach involves solving problems where the goal is to find the longest subsequence that is common to two sequences.

8. **Matrix Chain Multiplication DP**: This approach involves solving problems where the goal is to find the optimal way to multiply a chain of matrices.

## Applications of Dynamic Programming
